# Uno

## Project Overview
Uno is a popular card game where players try to match colors or numbers and be the first to get rid of all their cards. This project implements the game using [mention the language or framework if applicable], allowing for single-player or multiplayer gameplay.

## How to Play

2. **Playing Cards**: Players take turns playing cards that match the color or number of the top card in the discard pile.
3. **Uno Call**: When a player has one card left, they must call "Uno!" to avoid penalties.
